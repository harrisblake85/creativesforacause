Creatives For A Cause  creatives submit a shirt design for a cause  most voted (shirt) of the month goes into *production  homepage shows most upvoted shirt design, at the end of the month the most upvoted shirt goes into production  user is allowed to =>  create/submit a t-shirt design, pre-order the pending winner, buy production version of last months winner.  And upvote current month submissions to choose the shirt that goes into production  When you preorder or buy a production winner,  => you choose the charity your profits go to.  Has a gallery of submissions sortable by votes and purchases  *probably wouldnt actually go into production/ allow people to buy unless interest was built [8:37 AM] The idea is a little rough right now but I really think I could pull it off [8:40 AM] Additional techs used would be integration of a secure payment method ie: paypal, integration of upload-able images integration of some type of design [8:40 AM] software for the t shirts
